        "ai": "Hello there! I'm ready to help you on your journey to learn Arabic.\n\nIt's great that you already know the alphabet and can read with harakat! That gives us a fantastic starting point.\n\nAccording to our roadmap, we'll begin with **Stage 1: Foundation Strengthening**. Our first key objective here is to **build a strong vocabulary**. This is crucial for understanding and expressing yourself in Arabic.\n\nOur daily plan for vocabulary involves learning around 20 words a day for 20 minutes, ideally using tools like Anki or Memrise.\n\nLet's start with some essential everyday vocabulary. For each word, I'll provide the Arabic word, its transliteration, and its English meaning.\n\n***\n\n### **Day 1: Essential Vocabulary**\n\n1.  **مرحبا** (marhaba) - Hello / Welcome\n2.  **أهلاً وسهلاً** (ahlan wa sahlan) - Welcome (often used as a response to مرحبا)\n3.  **صباح الخير** (sabah al-khayr) - Good morning\n4.  **مساء الخير** (masaa' al-khayr) - Good evening\n5.  **كيف حالك؟** (kayfa haluk?) - How are you? (masculine)\n6.  **كيف حالكِ؟** (kayfa haluki?) - How are you? (feminine)\n7.  **بخير، شكراً** (bi-khayr, shukran) - Fine, thank you\n8.  **أنا** (ana) - I / I am\n9.  **أنتَ** (anta) - You (masculine singular)\n10. **أنتِ** (anti) - You (feminine singular)\n\n***\n\n**Your first task:**\n\nPlease read these words aloud a few times to get comfortable with their pronunciation. Then, try to write them down without looking at the transliteration.\n\nOnce you've done that, let's practice! How would you say \"Hello, how are you?\" to a male friend, and then to a female friend?\n\n[PROGRESS: Stage 1 - Vocabulary Day 1]"

        "ai": "That's a great start!\n\nYou're very close with \"مرحب\". The more common and complete greeting is **مرحبا** (marhaba). It's just adding the **ا** (alif) at the end.\n\nAnd **كيف حالك؟** (kayfa haluk?) is absolutely correct for asking \"How are you?\" to a male friend. Excellent!\n\nNow, can you recall how you would say \"Hello, how are you?\" to a **female** friend? Remember, there was a slight difference in the \"you\" pronoun for females.\n\nTake your time and give it a try!\n\n[PROGRESS: Stage 1 - Vocabulary Day 1]"

        "ai": "Excellent! **كيف حالكِ؟** (kayfa haluki?) is perfectly correct for asking \"How are you?\" to a female friend. You've got the distinction down!\n\nYou've successfully completed the first part of our vocabulary practice. To round out our \"20 words a day\" goal for this session, let's learn 10 more essential words.\n\n***\n\n### **Day 1: Essential Vocabulary (Part 2)**\n\n11. **نعم** (na'am) - Yes\n12. **لا** (la) - No\n13. **شكراً** (shukran) - Thank you\n14. **عفواً** (afwan) - You're welcome / Excuse me\n15. **مع السلامة** (ma'a as-salama) - Goodbye\n16. **اسمي** (ismi) - My name is\n17. **ما اسمك؟** (ma ismuk?) - What is your name? (masculine)\n18. **ما اسمكِ؟** (ma ismuki?) - What is your name? (feminine)\n19. **طالب** (talib) - Student (masculine)\n20. **طالبة** (talibah) - Student (feminine)\n\n***\n\n**Your next task:**\n\nJust like before, please read these new words aloud a few times to get comfortable with their pronunciation. Pay special attention to the difference between the masculine and feminine forms of \"What is your name?\" and \"student.\"\n\nOnce you've practiced, try to tell me:\n1. How would you say \"Yes, thank you\"?\n2. How would you introduce yourself by saying \"My name is [Your Name]\"? (You can use your real name or a placeholder).\n\nDon't worry about perfection, just give it your best shot!\n\n[PROGRESS: Stage 1 - Vocabulary Day 1]"

        "ai": "Perfect! **اسمي يوسف** (ismi Yusuf) is absolutely correct. You've successfully introduced yourself in Arabic!\n\nYou've done a fantastic job with the first day's vocabulary. You've learned and practiced 20 essential words and phrases, and you're already using them in simple sentences.\n\nNow that we've strengthened our vocabulary foundation for the day, let's move on to the next objective in **Stage 1: Foundation Strengthening** – understanding basic grammar, specifically **sentence structure**.\n\nArabic sentences can generally be divided into two main types:\n\n1.  **Nominal Sentences (الجملة الاسمية - al-jumlah al-ismiyyah):** These sentences start with a noun or pronoun and usually describe something about that noun. They don't have a visible verb like \"to be\" in English.\n    *   They consist of two main parts:\n        *   **Subject (المبتدأ - al-mubtada'):** The noun or pronoun that the sentence is about.\n        *   **Predicate (الخبر - al-khabar):** The part that gives information about the subject.\n\n    **Example:**\n    *   **أنا طالب.** (Ana talib.) - I am a student.\n        *   **أنا** (ana) = Subject (I)\n        *   **طالب** (talib) = Predicate (a student)\n\n    Notice how there's no \"am\" explicitly stated. It's implied.\n\n2.  **Verbal Sentences (الجملة الفعلية - al-jumlah al-fi'liyyah):** These sentences start with a verb. We'll dive deeper into these later, but for now, let's focus on nominal sentences, as they are very common for introducing oneself and describing things.\n\n***\n\n**Let's practice with nominal sentences using the vocabulary you just learned:**\n\nWe know:\n*   **أنا** (ana) - I / I am\n*   **أنتَ** (anta) - You (masculine singular)\n*   **أنتِ** (anti) - You (feminine singular)\n*   **طالب** (talib) - Student (masculine)\n*   **طالبة** (talibah) - Student (feminine)\n\n**Your task:**\n\nHow would you say the following sentences in Arabic?\n\n1.  \"You are a student.\" (speaking to a male)\n2.  \"You are a student.\" (speaking to a female)\n3.  \"I am fine.\" (Remember: بخير, شكراً means \"Fine, thank you\" - you can just use the \"fine\" part.)\n\nGive it a try! Don't worry if it's not perfect, the goal is to practice.\n\n[PROGRESS: Stage 1 - Grammar Practice Day 1]"
