<br/>Welcome back! Absolutely, let's pick up right where we left off and continue our Arabic learning journey.<br/><br/>We are currently in <strong>Stage 1: Foundation Strengthening</strong>, and we were just beginning <strong>Day 4</strong> of our daily plan.<br/><br/>Last time, we introduced 10 new vocabulary words, including some professions and other useful terms:<br/><br/>1.  مهندس (muhandis) - Engineer (masculine)<br/>2.  مهندسة (muhandisah) - Engineer (feminine)<br/>3.  مترجم (mutarjim) - Translator (masculine)<br/>4.  مترجمة (mutarjimah) - Translator (feminine)<br/>5.  طالب (talib) - Student (masculine) (review)<br/>6.  طالبة (talibah) - Student (feminine) (review)<br/>7.  درس (dars) - Lesson<br/>8.  جامعة (jami\'ah) - University (feminine word)<br/>9.  عمل (amal) - Work / Job<br/>10. شغل (shughl) - Work / Job (common in spoken Arabic, similar to amal)<br/><br/>Your task was to:<br/><br/>1.  Read these new words aloud several times, paying close attention to the masculine and feminine pairs and the ة (taa marbuta) that signals femininity.<br/>2.  Based on the spelling, identify which of the new singular nouns (درس, جامعة, عمل, شغل) are feminine.<br/><br/>Please let me know which of these nouns you identify as feminine!<br/><br/>[PROGRESS: Stage 1 - Vocabulary Day 4]<br/>
